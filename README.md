# Mouse Jiggler for Flipper Zero
Modified "Mouse USB Preview" and another person's jiggle code to create THIS jiggle app that constently jiggles!

## Installing
1. Download the FAP file from the [release page](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/flipper-mouse-jiggler/releases).
2. Copy the FAP file to your Flipper. The easiest way to do this is by using the [qFlipper desktop application](https://flipperzero.one/downloads). The recommended storage location for this application is `SD Card/apps/USB/`.
3. On your Flipper, navigate to `Apps > USB > Mouse Jiggler` and launch the application.
4. Plug your Flipper in to a computer using a USB cable. While the application is running, the Flipper will present itself to the computer as a mouse and send arbitrary movement instructions to the system.
